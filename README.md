Kick a Kid


This is a silly game idea spawned from too many coding frustrations.... no children were harmed in the making of this game. :) 



    run npm -f install in game directory. (Hopefully should install everything needed)
    run bower install to get the rest.
    Type: "gulp" which will hopefully start up the local web server.
    Navigate to http://localhost:9000/index.html to view game. (Any code edits should update and be viewable after a page refresh)
